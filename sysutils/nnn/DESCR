nnn is probably the fastest and most resource-sensitive file manager you have
ever used. It integrates seamlessly with your DE and favourite GUI utilities,
has a unique navigate-as-you-type mode with auto-select, disk usage analyzer
mode, bookmarks, contexts, application launcher, familiar navigation shortcuts,
subshell spawning and much more.

Integrate utilities like sxiv or fzy easily, transfer selected files using
lftp or use it as a (neo)vim plugin; nnn supports as many scripts as you need!
