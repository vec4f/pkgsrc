This is currently a, hopefully, simple to use LibSass Go API. It
uses the C bindings in https://github.com/wellington/go-libsass/libs
to do the heavy lifting.

The primary motivation for this project is to add SCSS support to
Hugo. It is has some generic tocss package names hoping that there
will be a solid native Go implementation that can replace LibSass
in the near future.
