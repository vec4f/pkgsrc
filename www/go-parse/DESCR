This package contains several lexers and parsers written in Go.
All subpackages are built to be streaming, high performance and to
be in accordance with the official (latest) specifications.

The lexers are implemented using buffer.Lexer in
https://github.com/tdewolff/parse/buffer and the parsers work on
top of the lexers. Some subpackages have hashes defined (using
Hasher) that speed up common byte-slice comparisons.
