This project aims to provide a sensible means of storing and managing arbitrary
HTML element attributes for later emitting them into templates.

There are a wide variety of types of attributes and using the "normal" Django
method of adding ModelFields for each on a business model is cumbersome at best
and moreover may require related tables to allow cases where any number of the
same type of attribute should be supported (i.e., data-attributes). This can
contribute to performance problems.

To avoid these pitfalls, this package allows all of these attributes to be
stored together in a single text field in the database as a JSON blob, but
provides a nice widget to provide an intuitive, key/value pair interface and
provide sensible validation of the keys used.
