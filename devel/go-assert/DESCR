Go assertion library (fork of stretchr/testify/require)

This is a fork of stretchr's assertion library that does two things:

    It makes spotting differences in equality much easier. It uses
    repr and diffmatchpatch to display structural differences in
    colour.

    Aborts tests on first assertion failure (the same behaviour as
    stretchr/testify/require).
