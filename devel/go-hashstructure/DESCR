hashstructure is a Go library for creating a unique hash value for
arbitrary values in Go.

This can be used to key values in a hash (for use in a map, set,
etc.) that are complex. The most common use case is comparing two
values without sending data across the network, caching values
locally (de-dup), and so on.
